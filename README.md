# stock-analysis

Overview:
  The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate how 12 different green energy stocks performed in 2017 and 2018 in order to help my friend Steve give his parents advice on which       stock to invest in.
  
Results:
  
Summary:
  1. One major advantage of refactoring the code is the speed that the program runs. Attached is a screenshot showing the popup when the original code was run for 2017 [https://github.com/azarowj/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Screen%20Shot%202021-02-26%20at%208.06.04%20PM.png] which can be compared to how quickly it ran with the refactored code for 2017 [https://github.com/azarowj/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png]. This is also evident with the speed for 2018 as seen next [https://github.com/azarowj/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Screen%20Shot%202021-02-26%20at%208.06.17%20PM.png] [https://github.com/azarowj/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png]
